# RoboticsThreeLawsSimulator
This project is a simulator based on Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. It demonstrates how robots make decisions in scenarios with humans, considering the number of humans in danger, available robots, and actions. The goal is to illustrate the impact of these laws in real-world situations.
